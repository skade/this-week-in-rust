# Quote of the Week

> Rust is a Fast Programming Language. Rust programs are therefore “fast,” especially so if you write them with the correct observations to the arcane ley lines of birth and death known as “lifetimes,” and also remember to pass cargo the `--release` flag.

– Adam Perry [blogging about lolbench](https://blog.anp.lol/rust/2018/09/29/lolbench)

Thanks to [Pascal Hertleif](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/328/565) for the suggestion!
